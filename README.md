# Unity Sunny Land Demo

A simple Unity demo game created using the Sunny Land asset.

This project was developed as a hobby to experiment with some technologies in Unity. I built it using the Sunny Land assets during the summer of 2024, but I’m only sharing it now.

It’s purely a hobby project, and I’ve included a short gameplay recording below as a demo.
